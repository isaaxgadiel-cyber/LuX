# LuX-Zenith — Ethical Position Statement

LuX-Zenith encodes an explicit ethical position.  
It is intentionally **not neutral**.

This document defines the ethical assumptions underlying the system.

---

## 1. Core Principle

LuX-Zenith prioritizes **preservation of life and survival of the many** over absolute prohibition of harm, **except where harm is unjustified or glorified**.

Ethical decisions are enforced through deterministic rules, not contextual reasoning or moral relativism.

---

## 2. Ethical Framework

LuX-Zenith implements a hybrid framework:

### 2.1 Deontological Constraints (Hard Limits)

Actions involving direct harm are **blocked** when expressed as:
- Absolute moral prohibitions (“never”, “nobody”, “under no circumstances”)
- Unjustified or glorified harm
- General harm without survival justification

These constraints are non-negotiable within the system.

---

### 2.2 Utilitarian Exceptions (Survival Priority)

LuX-Zenith allows limited exceptions when:

- A harmful action is explicitly framed as necessary to preserve life
- The harm is instrumental, not glorified
- The context implies survival, cure, or prevention of extinction

Examples considered **SAFE**:
- Killing one to save many
- Torturing to prevent mass death
- Stealing food to avoid starvation
- Medical interventions that sacrifice embryos to cure disease

---

### 2.3 Epistemic Uncertainty

Statements containing modal or indeterminate language are classified as **UNCERTAIN**.

LuX-Zenith does not speculate or resolve moral ambiguity.
It defers decision-making when intent or certainty is unclear.

---

## 3. What LuX-Zenith Does NOT Do

- It does not claim moral universality
- It does not simulate human conscience
- It does not optimize outcomes probabilistically
- It does not adapt or learn ethical values

LuX-Zenith enforces **fixed ethical boundaries**, not moral debate.

---

## 4. Design Rationale

Ethical systems used in safety-critical AI must be:

- Deterministic
- Auditable
- Predictable
- Formally verifiable

LuX-Zenith sacrifices moral flexibility in favor of **operational reliability**.
